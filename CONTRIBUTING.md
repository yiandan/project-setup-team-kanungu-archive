# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms
- An aspect of the project is done when developers and graders are satisfied with it.
- Listen to member's ideas and thoughts
- Try to resolve issues in the project without blaming anyone.
- If you are having trouble with a task, let others know ASAP.
- If you see an issue that hasn't been brought up by anyone, bring it up.
- Prioritize the most important tasks first and work in order of importance.

## Team Values
- Commitment: Members of the team must be committed to finishing the project and putting commitment into the project, while not being undercommited or overcommited. 
- Courage: Temm members must have the courage to speak out on issues of the project, and to say no to a task if they believe they do not have the ability to do it, or to ask for help if they need it. 
- Collaborating: Members must be willing to assist and collaborate on the project with other team members and work on features of the app together. 
- Respect: Team members must show each other respect.
- Focus: Members must focus on the assigned tasks and finish them before moving on to new tasks.


## Sprint Cadence

We will follow the cadence of the class; sprints will be 2 weeks each.

## Daily Standups

We will have daily standups for 5-10 minutes on the following schedule:
- Monday before class at 3:20pm
- Wednesday before class at 3:20pm
- Sunday evening at 8pm

Link: https://nyu.zoom.us/j/5266146549

As per class/scrum instructions:
- we agree that members will not cover for other members who do not participate
- we agree that a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or
  more in a row will be reported to management

## Git Workflow
Clone the repository
Create a new branch for individual task(s)
Modify the files (source code)
Name the commitment
Commit changes to individual branch
Create patch
Make a pull request
Merge the request if everything works alright

## Rules of Contributing
We will distribute task based on self-recommending first, this way we can gauge 
which parts of the task each member is most interested in doing and their 
comfortability. After taking this into account and looking for areas of synergy 
and overlap, we will then divide up the work equally and fairly to each team 
members in a way that each person feels comfortable with the work they are doing. 
Team members will be allowed to present further ideas over and above what they 
have been asked to do if their bandwidth allows, and this will be taken into 
account and implemented if the team agrees to.

## Conflict Resolve
Disagreement or conflicts will be resolved based on a fair and democratic process. 
We will attempt to identify the drivers of conflict versus only looking at the 
symptoms of the conflict. After assessing the cases of all the sides of the conflict, 
we will attempt to resolve amicably by finding common ground. If it is a fundamental 
difference in point of view, we will resort voting and the one with the most votes 
wins.

## Local Development Environment Setup
Slack for team communication
Draw.io for drafting wireframe 
InVision for designing prototype
GitHub for building up the project
Zoom for team meeting
Visual Studio to be used as the code editor

## How to Build and Test Project
The project can be built following the steps seen in the github actions workflow. Namely, once the project has been cloned, npm install must be run in the main project directory, as well as the back-end directory. Some modules may not load, even though they are in the dependencies list, so be alert for some errors. Unfortunately, which modules are not installed seems somewhat irregular so it cannot be predicted beforehand. The module errors will inform which did not install. A .env file will also need to be added to the main directory, which conents have been shared via slack channel.
